; Fixes
FIX_SEARCH_IN_BATTLE:               equ 1       ; Restore the ability to search chests during battle.

FIX_INCREASE_DOUBLE_RESETS_COUNTER: equ 1       ; Equipment that increases the chance to double attack also erroneously set the chance to counter attack to 1/32.
FIX_GODDESS_STAFF_DEALS_ABUSE:      equ 1       ; If one of the following items is sitting in the Deals section after a DEF-CON switch is activated: Quick Ring, Protect Ring, White Ring, or Running Ring; a Goddess Staff will also be added to Deals.
FIX_GARBLED_HP_BAR:                 equ 1       ; Prevent drawing garbage pixels when HP is greater then 600. (Keep drawing black bars instead.)
FIX_KIWI_SPELLS_LEARNING_LEVEL:     equ 1       ; Kiwi's base class is wrongfully treated as promoted for the purpose of learning spells.
FIX_HIGINS_SPELL:                   equ 1       ; Prevent unequipping from possibly corrupting characters spell entries.
FIX_MOVEMENT_GLITCH:                equ 1       ; The movement glitch is used in battles to reach places which are out of the controlled character's moving boundaries.
FIX_PRISM_FLOWER_OVERWORLD_ENTRANCE:equ 1       ; On Map 77, walking to the right on the tile closest to the bottom mountain brings the player into the Prism Flower battle rather than to the world map to the right.
FIX_CARAVAN_FREE_REPAIR_EXPLOIT:    equ 1       ; Preserve the broken bit when items are stored in the Caravan. (Inventory is reducded to 32 items unless SRAM is expanded.)

BOWIE_CAN_LEAVE_BATTLE_PARTY:       equ 0       ; Player is required to leave at least one member in the party. Message #20 should be edited to reflect this new rule.
CAPITALIZED_CHARACTER_NAMES:        equ 0       ; Capitalize allies and enemies names, as well as change "JAR" and the Chess Army's "DARK BISHOP" to "Jaro" and "Bishop".
PERCENT_POISON_DAMAGE:              equ 30       ; 1-100 = n% of max HP
PLAYER_DEFEAT_IS_GAME_OVER:         equ 0       ; On player defeat, rather than halve the gold and return to town, reset the game.
SOUND_TEST_RESTORATION:             equ 1       ; Reimplement Sound Test functions that are missing in the US version. Based on Earl's patch.
