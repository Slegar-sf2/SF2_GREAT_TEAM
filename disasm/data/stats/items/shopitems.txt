 [Store Length][Item Code 1][..]

 Store length tells how many item slots ahead of that byte to read in. At the end of 
 this list is an "uber store" with every item in it - it may or may not be accessable
 by a sekrit code or some such. There is a max size a store can take without glitching up,
 which is 128, I assume.
